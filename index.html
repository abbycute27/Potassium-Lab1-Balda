		        <h1>Roblox</h1>
				<p>It is an online game platform and game creation system developed by Roblox Corporation that allows users to program and play games created by themselves or other users. 
				Created by David Baszucki and Erik Cassel in 2004 and released in 2006, the platform hosts user-created games of multiple genres coded in the programming language Lua. 
				Early in Roblox's history, it was relatively small, both as a platform and as a company.
				Roblox began to grow rapidly in the second half of the 2010s, and this growth was accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
